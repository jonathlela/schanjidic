= schanjidic

schanjidic is a collection of scripts to query kanji information from
+kanjidic+ written in scheme.

== Setup

You need http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/[guile 2.0] and a copy of
http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic.html[kanjidic] to run
these scripts.

== Files

* +/+
** +alist.scm+ : the data structure used to represent the information
about a kanji.
** +kanjifields.scm+ : holds informations about the fields of
+kanjidic+.
** +schanjidic.scm+ : builds a internal representation of a +kanjidic+
file.
** +test.scm+ : checks that the built representation of +kanjidic+ is
correct.
** +daemon.scm+ : a server that handles kanji queries.
* +/html/+
** +html.scm+ : a web client for schanjidic.
** +kanjidic.html+ : a webpage that uses the web client to dynamicly
display kanji informations (needs http://jquery.com/[jquery]).
** +html/kanjidic.css+ : a css file for this webpage.

== Usage

schanjidic comes with three main scripts :

=== +daemon.scm+

This is is the main script of schanjidic, it runs as a sever that
retrieves the kanji informations queried by the clients. Theses
informations are returned as +s-expressions+ that can be directly
evaluated by lips-family languages, or easyly parsed by the others.

For example, if you are at the root of the schanjidic directory, you
can launch the daemon as follow :

--------------------------------------
schanjidic$ guile -L . daemon.scm /usr/share/edict/kanjidic&
--------------------------------------

=== +html.scm+

This script is a web client for schanjidic, it takes a single URI
parameter from the standard input and returns an +HTML+ output that
contains the information from the queried kanji. Example with +é½’+ :
 
--------------------------------------
schanjidic$ guile html/html.scm < echo "kanji=%E9%BD%92"
-------------------------------------- 

A running webpage using this client can be found at
http://azubato.net/kanjidic.html.

=== +test.scm+

This script checks if the dictionnay built by schanjidic matches with
the kanjidic file provided :

--------------------------------------
schanjidic$ guile -L . test.scm /usr/share/edict/kanjidic
--------------------------------------

== To come

An +elisp+ client to use schanjidic within +emacs+.
